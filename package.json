  "description": "This repository demonstrates how to setup a coprocessor with the Router to evaluate policy-based authorization with the `@policy` directive. Note that this repo currently does not enforce authentication via a JWT or other token for the sake of simplicity. In a real code base, you would likely have a consumer provided token in a header which would be passed down to the \"auth service\", not the hard coding that this example does.",
