description: A demonstration of how to set up a coprocessor with the router to
  evaluate policy-based authorization with the `@policy` directive. Note that
  this repo currently does not enforce authentication via a JWT or other token
  for the sake of simplicity. In production code, you would likely have a
  consumer-provided token in a header, which would be passed down to the auth
  service.
